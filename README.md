### Usage
----------
To use Unumico, simply download the contents of this repository to your site root, and customise it as you wish.

### Features
-------------

- **Responsive** â€” The website template is built to be both mobile friendly and desktop friendly, with different layouts that should automatically adjust to your screen or windows size (according to the Google Chrome Developer Tools).

- **Scripts** - It comes with a contact form that uses a responsive script to send emails using the mailto function, scroll to top or bottom buttons, an automatically updating copyright year, self-changing site title (depending on what page you are on) and content that fades in at a comfortable speed when the page loads - among many small other site-improving and useful scripts (JavaScript/jQuery).

- **One Page** - The template is built for the whole sites content to be on the one page, with different articles that appear and disappear depending on which page id you are visiting.
